# Mobile Development Setup

## 0. Setting Up and Testing Your Mobile Development Environment

### Objective
Mobile development requires more resources compared to web development. We are using **Expo Framework** to simplify testing React Native apps on physical devices.

### Tools Installed
- Node.js LTS ✅
- VS Code ✅
- Operating System: (Windows/Linux/macOS) ✅
- Expo Go App on device ✅

### Steps Followed
1. Installed **Expo Go** from the [official homepage](https://expo.dev/go).
2. Logged into Expo Go with a new/existing account.
3. Linked Expo Go with development environment by scanning the QR code.

### Why Expo Go?
- Avoids heavy simulators/emulators.
- Allows direct testing on real Android/iOS devices.
- Cost-effective and efficient.

### Challenges
- _(Write here if you faced issues, e.g., Expo Go not connecting, QR code not scanning, etc.)_
- In my case: Expo Go connected successfully and displayed the default app.
